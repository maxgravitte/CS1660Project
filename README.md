Solution to CS 1660 Project Option 2.
The inverted indices and TopN hadoop jars function.
GCP is successfully connected to from Java GUI.
GUI however is not run as a docker file.
There is a bug in displaying the Top N results where the terms are not preserved in the Jtable, only the frequencies.

Execution Instructions
Inside Client.java replace path to google cloud credentials.
Alternatively, given the full project structure, replace data/default/credentials.json with your credentials.

If executing as docker image, set $DISPLAY=<youripaddress>:0.0
