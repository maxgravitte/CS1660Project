# CS1660Project

Solution to CS 1660 Project Option 2.
The inverted indices and TopN hadoop jars function.
GCP is successfully connected to from Java GUI.
GUI however is not run as a docker file.
There is a bug in displaying the Top N results where the terms are not preserved in the Jtable, only the frequencies.
